# Comparison

## N-gram Models vs. Alternative Approaches

### 1. **Statistical Foundations**
- **N-grams**: Rely exclusively on local co-occurrence statistics (Markov assumption), limiting context to fixed-length sequences.  
- **Neural LMs (e.g., RNNs, Transformers)**: Capture long-range dependencies through hidden states or attention mechanisms, but require significantly more data and computation.  
- **Rule-Based Systems**: Use handcrafted linguistic rules (e.g., CFGs), avoiding data sparsity but lacking scalability.  

### 2. **Trade-offs in Performance**
| Feature               | N-grams                          | Neural LMs                     | Rule-Based Systems          |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Training Speed**     | Fast (count-based)               | Slow (gradient optimization)   | Moderate (rule engineering) |
| **Interpretability**   | High (explicit probabilities)    | Low (black-box embeddings)     | Highest (explicit rules)    |
| **Data Efficiency**    | Poor (sparsity issues)           | Moderate (generalization)      | N/A (no training data)      |
| **OOV Handling**       | Requires smoothing/backoff       | Embeddings mitigate OOV        | Rules must explicitly cover |

### 3. **Use Case Alignment**
- **N-grams** excel in:  
  - Low-resource scenarios with limited compute (e.g., embedded systems).  
  - Tasks requiring transparency (e.g., grammar checking).  
- **Neural LMs** dominate:  
  - High-resource applications (e.g., machine translation).  
  - When semantic coherence is critical.  

## Chapter Conclusion  
N-gram models offer unmatched simplicity and interpretability for local pattern modeling, making them ideal for lightweight or explainable systems. However, their rigidity in handling sparsity and context underscores the need for hybrid approaches (e.g., interpolating with neural LMs) â€” a direction explored in later chapters on *Smoothing Techniques* and *Model Integration*.

## Efficiency Considerations for n-gram Models

### 1. Data Structures for Frequency Storage
- **Trie-based indexing**: 
  - Prefix trees for compact storage of n-gram hierarchies
  - Time complexity: O(m) for lookup (m = n-gram length)
- **Hash tables with backoff**:
  - O(1) average-case lookup with separate chaining
  - Memory optimization through probabilistic filters

### 2. Smoothing Techniques Comparison
| Technique       | Memory Overhead | Perplexity Reduction | Best Use Case        |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Add-k          | Low             | 15-20%               | Small corpora        |
| Kneser-Ney     | Moderate        | 25-35%               | General purpose      |
| Modified Kneser-Ney | High      | 35-45%               | Large vocabularies   |

### 3. Pruning Strategies
**Entropy-based pruning**:
```python
def prune_ngram(model, threshold):
    return {k:v for k,v in model.items() 
            if -sum(p*log(p) for p in probs) > threshold}
```

**Count-cutoff pruning**:
- Empirical results show 90% size reduction with <2% accuracy loss when cutting n-grams with count â‰¤3

### 4. Parallel Processing
- MapReduce implementation for distributed counting:
  - Mapper: `emit((ngram), 1)`
  - Reducer: `sum(values)`
- GPU acceleration for matrix operations in neural n-gram hybrids

## Chapter Conclusion
Effective optimization of n-gram models requires balancing computational complexity with statistical validity. The techniques presented - from efficient data structures to algorithmic pruning - demonstrate practical pathways to deployable implementations. These optimizations directly support the core thesis by making higher-order n-gram models computationally feasible for real-world language processing tasks. The next section will explore evaluation metrics to quantify these performance improvements.

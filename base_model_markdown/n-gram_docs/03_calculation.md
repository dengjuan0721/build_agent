# Calculation

## 1. Fundamental Concepts

### 1.1 Probability Estimation
The core calculation in n-gram models involves estimating the probability of a word sequence. For an n-gram $w_1...w_n$, the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) is:

$$
P(w_n | w_1...w_{n-1}) = \frac{C(w_1...w_n)}{C(w_1...w_{n-1})}
$$

Where:
- $C(\cdot)$ denotes count in the training corpus
- Denominator represents the context window of size (n-1)

### 1.2 Context Window Handling
Special cases require attention:
- **Sentence boundaries**: Padding with start/end tokens (e.g., `<s>`, `</s>`)
- **Unknown words**: Designated `<UNK>` token with pre-processing strategies

## 2. Practical Implementation

### 2.1 Count Matrix Construction
A typical implementation involves:

1. **Corpus preprocessing**:
   - Tokenization
   - Lowercasing (optional)
   - Special token insertion

2. **N-dimensional sparse matrix**:
   - Dimensions: $|V|^{n-1} \times |V|$ (V = vocabulary)
   - Storage optimization using hash maps or tries

### 2.2 Smoothing Techniques
Common methods to handle zero-probability n-grams:

| Technique       | Formula                          | Use Case               |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| Add-k Smoothing | $\frac{C(w_1...w_n) + k}{C(w_1...w_{n-1}) + k|V|}$ | Small corpora         |
| Backoff         | $\lambda P(w_n\|w_2...w_{n-1})$ | Long-range dependencies|
| Interpolation   | $\sum_i \lambda_i P_i(w_n\|...)$| Balanced weighting    |

## 3. Computational Considerations

### 3.1 Efficiency Optimization
Key strategies include:
- **Memoization**: Cache frequent n-gram lookups
- **Pruning**: Discount rare n-grams (count < threshold)
- **Bloom filters**: For approximate membership tests

### 3.2 Memory Footprint
Storage requirements grow exponentially with n:
- Bigram (2-gram): $O(|V|^2)$
- Trigram (3-gram): $O(|V|^3)$
- Practical limit: Typically n â‰¤ 5 for most applications

## 4. Validation Metrics

### 4.1 Perplexity Calculation
Standard measure of model quality:

$$
PP(W) = \sqrt[N]{\prod_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{P(w_i|w_{i-n+1}...w_{i-1})}}
$$

Where:
- $W$ = test sequence
- $N$ = number of tokens

### 4.2 Cross-Validation
Recommended workflow:
1. Partition corpus into k folds
2. Train on k-1 folds, test on held-out fold
3. Average perplexity across all folds

## Chapter Conclusion

This chapter established the mathematical foundations for n-gram probability calculations, covering essential techniques from basic count-based estimation to advanced smoothing methods. The presented computational strategies address real-world constraints in model implementation, while validation metrics provide objective quality assessment. These calculation principles form the basis for practical applications discussed in subsequent chapters, where we'll explore optimization techniques and hybrid modeling approaches.
